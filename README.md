# Payment-Fraud-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect anomalies presented in Online payment transactions and classifies transactions as fraudulent and not.

+ Statistically and Analytically analyzed the data and using **BenfordsLaw** detected the presence of anomalies in the data.
+ Compared different anomaly detection models based on the anomaly detection performance and separated anomalies presented using **iForest** Algorithm.
+ Utilizing Classification algorithms, classified fraudulent transactions from non-fraudulent transactions for future detection of frauds. Acquired Classification Accuracy of 99% with **LighGBM** Algorithm.
+ Created Preprocessing including balancing data using SMOTE and modeling Pipeline using **Pycaret Opensource Library**.
+ Transferred models and pipeline to **Tableau** for detecting anomalies in the future data and to Build a dashboard using Tableau.

## Tools Used:
+ Python Packages: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pycaret
+ Anomaly Detection Model : iForest,knn,SVM,Cluster
+ Classification Model : LightGBM
+ Tableau
